# Kubeflow with Cognito on EKS
The following project demonstrates the process of deploying a secure implementation of Kubeflow on top of a Kubernetes cluster provided by Amazon's Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS). The Kubeflow deployment is secured using an application load balancer (ALB), Route 53 and Amazon Cognito.

## Prerequisites
- [AWS access key ID and secret access key](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/getting-started_create-delegated-user.html)
- jq (1.6)
- awscli (v1.18.179)
- [kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl/#install-kubectl) (v1.19.4)
- [eksctl](https://eksctl.io) (v0.31.0)
- [aws-iam-authenticator](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/install-aws-iam-authenticator.html) (v0.5.2)
- [kfctl](https://github.com/kubeflow/kfctl/releases/tag/v1.1.0) (v1.1.0-0-g9a3621e)

This project assumes that you already have a domain registered through Amazon Route 53 so that subdomains can be easily created and managed. If not, this [guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/domain-register.html) demonstrates the process.

## 1. EKS Cluster Creation
Before creating the EKS cluster make sure that the Kubernetes config file generated by AWS is empty. This can be achieved by deleting it as follows:
``` 
rm -rf /Users/<your-name>/.kube/config 
```

The EKS cluster can then be created by running:
``` 
eksctl create cluster -f eks_cluster.yaml 
```

Once the cluster has been created run the following command as a test to check that the desired nodes are ready.
```
kubectl get nodes
```

## 2. Cognito User Pool Creation
The Cognito user pool can be created via the `cognito.yaml` CloudFormation template by running the following AWS CLI command:
```
aws cloudformation create-stack \
    --stack-name "mlplatform-cognito-stack" \
    --template-body file://cognito.yaml \
    --capabilities CAPABILITY_IAM \
    --parameters ParameterKey=UserPoolName,ParameterValue=mlplatform \
    --region eu-west-1
```

This will provision the Cognito user pool that will be used to authenticate Kubeflow users.

## 3. Kubeflow Deployment
This Kubeflow deployment uses the following [manifest](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kubeflow/manifests/v1.1-branch/kfdef/kfctl_aws_cognito.v1.1.0.yaml) as a base. The kubeflow manifest file is defined dynamically using environment variables inside the `mlplatform/` directory. It is recommended to deploy Kubeflow inside a folder that shares the EKS cluster name. If you want to change the cluster name, make sure to update the `mlplatform/` directory and the `CLUSTER_NAME` environment variable.

Make sure to replace `domain.com` with your own domain name in the appropriate environment variables before proceeding. Kubeflow can be deployed on the cluster by running the following command:
```
sh deploy_kubeflow.sh
```

This deployment should take a few minutes and once ready the ALB should have a status of `active` in the AWS console. This means that Route 53 can now be updated and the domain can front the load balancer.

## Resource Cleanup
The EKS cluster can be deleted by running the following command:
```
eksctl delete cluster -f eks_cluster.yaml --profile nial-daly-cli
```

The Kubernetes config file can be deleted using the command shown:
```
rm -rf /Users/nialdaly/.kube/config
```
The artifacts generated by the kfctl `build` and `apply` commands can be deleted by running `sh clean_mlplatform.sh` in the root directory. If you wish to remove `kfctl` CLI tool, run:
```
rm -rf /usr/local/bin/kfctl
```
